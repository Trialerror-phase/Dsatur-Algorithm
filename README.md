Here’s a `README.md` file to document your DSatur algorithm project in a clear and user-friendly way:

```markdown
# DSatur Algorithm Project

This project implements the **DSatur algorithm** in Ruby for graph coloring, with a focus on comparing its performance on general and perfect (bipartite) graphs. The project includes features for generating random graphs, applying the DSatur algorithm, visualizing the results, and benchmarking performance.

## Requirements

- **Ruby**: Ensure Ruby is installed on your system.
- **GraphViz**: Install the GraphViz software for visualizing graphs.

### Install GraphViz

1. **Ubuntu / Debian**:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install graphviz
   ```
2. **macOS (using Homebrew)**:
   ```bash
   brew install graphviz
   ```
3. **Windows**:
   - Download from the [GraphViz website](https://graphviz.org/download/).
   - Run the installer and check the option to add GraphViz to the system PATH.

### Install Required Gems

Run the following command to install the Ruby gems:

```bash
gem install ruby-graphviz
```

## Project Structure

```plaintext
dsatur_project/
├── graph.rb            # Graph class and related methods
├── dsatur.rb           # DSatur algorithm implementation
├── generate_graphs.rb   # Functions to generate general and bipartite graphs
└── main.rb             # Main script to run experiments and visualize results
```

## Usage

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/dsatur-algorithm.git
cd dsatur-algorithm/dsatur_project
```

### Step 2: Run the Project

To execute the DSatur algorithm on both general and perfect graphs, and generate visualizations, run:

```bash
ruby main.rb
```

### Outputs

- The script will output color assignments and performance benchmarks in the terminal.
- Graph images showing node colors will be saved as `general_graph.png` and `bipartite_graph.png` in the project directory.

### Example Output

1. **Terminal Output**:
   - Color assignments and the number of colors used for both general and bipartite graphs.
   - Time benchmarks comparing performance between the two types of graphs.

2. **Graph Visualizations**:
   - `general_graph.png`: Visual representation of the general graph.
   - `bipartite_graph.png`: Visual representation of the bipartite (perfect) graph.

## Makefile Commands

You can also use the provided Makefile for convenience:

```bash
make run
```

This will run `main.rb` and generate the visualizations as described above.

## Benchmarks and Experimental Evaluation

This project benchmarks the DSatur algorithm by recording the time it takes to color both general and perfect graphs. Results provide insights into the performance and efficiency of DSatur when applied to different graph structures.
